# SYNOPSIS

```go
f := strftime.New(`.... pattern ...`)
if err := f.Format(buf, time.Now()); err != nil {
    log.Println(err.Error())
}
```

# DESCRIPTION

The goals for this library are

* Optimized for the same pattern being called repeatedly
* Be flexible about destination to write the results out
* Be as complete as possible in terms of conversion specifications

# API

## Format(string, time.Time) (string, error)

Takes the pattern and the time, and formats it. This function is a utility function that recompiles the pattern every time the function is called. If you know beforehand that you will be formatting the same pattern multiple times, consider using `New` to create a `Strftime` object and reuse it.

## New(string) (\*Strftime, error)

Takes the pattern and creates a new `Strftime` object.

## obj.Pattern() string

Returns the pattern string used to create this `Strftime` object

## obj.Format(io.Writer, time.Time) error

Formats the time according to the pre-compiled pattern, and writes the result to the specified `io.Writer`

## obj.FormatString(time.Time) (string, error)

Formats the time according to the pre-compiled pattern, and returns the result string.

# SUPPORTED CONVERSION SPECIFICATIONS

| %z      | the time zone offset from UTC |
| %%      | a '%' |

# PERFORMANCE / OTHER LIBRARIES

This library is much faster than `github.com/tebeka/strftime` *IF* you can reuse the format pattern. Furthermore, depending on your pattern, we may not be able to achieve much speed gain. Patches, tests welcome.

This benchmark only uses the subset of conversion specifications that are supported by *ALL* of the libraries compared.

Currently this library allocates the least (if pattern is reused), but can do better to catch up with other strftime implementations.

Somethings to consider: 

* Can it write to io.Writer?
* Which `%specification` does it handle?
